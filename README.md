Hi, I am Pablo (he/they)! I work from home as an Open Source Software Engineer at [Datadog :dog:](https://www.datadoghq.com/). Apart from developing FOSS software, I like theoretical computer science, political economy and philosophy of science.

I have done [a bunch of stuff](https://mx-psi.github.io).
I occasionally write at [my blog](https://codual.github.io) and I log there things I read [bi-monthly](https://codual.github.io/log). Feel free to [drop an email](https://mx-psi.github.io/contact) if you want to talk!
